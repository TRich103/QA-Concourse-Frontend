# QA-search-bar

A search component that takes an array of JSON objects as props as the data to be searched. 

### Components
- searchContainer.component.js takes in the data to be searched and contains the search function.
- searchBar.component.js renders a search bar and executes the search function.
- demoDisplay.component.js is a placeholder display for the search results.

### Demo Deployment

```
npm install
npm start
```
Changing the JSON in the props of 'SearchContainer' in App.js will change the initial data to be searched.
